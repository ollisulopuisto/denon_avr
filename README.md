# Denon AVR

> **About this fork.** This is a fork of [LaserGuruGuy/denon_avr](https://github.com/LaserGuruGuy/denon_avr); all credit for the integration goes there. The fork adds a few things, each tested on a Denon AVR-X3600H. They are offered upstream, but the repository doesn't accept outside pull requests, so they live here:
>
> | Branch | What it adds |
> |---|---|
> | [`pr/sound-modes`](https://github.com/ollisulopuisto/denon_avr/tree/pr/sound-modes) | Sound modes are selected by their entry in the receiver's own list over HTTP (`AppCommand0300.xml`), with the telnet token as fallback. Fixes modes whose telnet token is unknown or doesn't exist (DTS Virtual:X on the X3600H), and duplicate entries in the sound mode select. |
> | [`pr/new-controls`](https://github.com/ollisulopuisto/denon_avr/tree/pr/new-controls) | Tuner (frequency, station name, band, tuning mode, preset), IMAX (mode, audio settings, filters, subwoofer), buttons for tuner step/preset and saving Quick Select 1–4, auto-standby, and power-on volume (Last / Mute / level). Each appears only if the receiver advertises it. |
> | [`pr/log-unhandled`](https://github.com/ollisulopuisto/denon_avr/tree/pr/log-unhandled) | Telnet replies the parser doesn't apply are logged at debug level. |
> | [`pr/test-harness`](https://github.com/ollisulopuisto/denon_avr/tree/pr/test-harness) | A pytest harness for the protocol library (no Home Assistant needed: `pip install -r requirements_test.txt && pytest tests`). |
> | [`combined`](https://github.com/ollisulopuisto/denon_avr/tree/combined) | All of the above together. |
>
> Not verified on the receiver yet: IMAX subwoofer output and the tuner station name. To try it, copy `custom_components/denon_avr` from the [`combined`](https://github.com/ollisulopuisto/denon_avr/tree/combined) branch into your Home Assistant `custom_components` folder and restart. This `main` branch is otherwise the same as upstream.

This is a HACS custom integration for Denon (HEOS generation) AV receivers such
as the AVR-X3600H.


## Features

- **Own, dependency free client.** Minimal external dependency.
- **Everything discovered from the device.** Model name, MAC, zones, input
  sources (and their renamed names + visibility), speaker configuration and
  channels, sound modes and their genre groups, quick select names, feature
  availability, control ranges and option labels are all read from the receiver
  at runtime. The only fixed data is the Denon wire grammar.
- **Telnet, HTTP** Telnet (port 23) provides the full state, real time push and
  the bulk of control; HTTP (port 8080) provides discovery and a periodic
  reconciliation poll. A few settings that have no telnet command (graphic‑EQ
  bands, HDMI/OSD/format setup, amp assign) are read and written over the setup
  config API (HTTPS 10443); everything else is telnet.
- **Stability** Auto reconnect with backoff, keepalive probe, command queue
  with inter command spacing, teardown on unload.

## Installation

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and open a repository inside the Home Assistant Community Store.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=LaserGuruGuy&repository=denon_avr&category=integration)

1. Install [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/) if you haven't already
2. HACS → Integrations → three dots → Custom repositories.
3. Add this repository as a [custom integration repository](https://hacs.xyz/docs/faq/custom_repositories), category "Integration".
4. Install integration "Denon AVR".
5. Restart Home Assistant.

### Manual
Copy the `denon_avr` folder into `<config>/custom_components/` and restart Home Assistant.

## Configuration

Settings → Devices & Services → Add Integration → **Denon AVR**, then enter the
receiver's **IP address**. The name and all capabilities are read from the device
automatically; no other input is required.

## Network ports and protocols

All traffic is on the local network and is initiated by Home Assistant (client)
towards the receiver (server). To let the two communicate through a router or
VLAN firewall, allow the Home Assistant host to reach the receiver on these
ports. Nothing needs to be opened towards the internet.

| **10443/tcp** | HTTPS (setup config) | Graphic‑EQ per‑band values, the Video setup menu (HDMI setup/CEC, ARC, OSD, TV/4K format) and Amp Assign — settings with no telnet token, read/write (non‑disruptive; self‑signed cert) | Optional (graphic EQ + video + amp assign) |

Notes:

- The receiver accepts **multiple concurrent telnet (23) connections** and
  broadcasts events to all of them, so this integration coexists with the Denon
  app and other controllers.
- The HEOS (1255) and setup‑config (10443) channels are only opened when the
  receiver advertises the matching capability; both are non‑disruptive.

## What you get

Settings are organized into **sub‑devices that mirror the receiver's own setup
menus**, so a large control set stays tidy instead of crowding one page. The main
receiver device keeps the day‑to‑day controls (player, power, source, sound mode,
quick select, input mode, front‑display dimmer); the **Audio**, **Video**,
**Picture**, **Speakers** and **Graphic EQ** sub‑devices each carry their own
part of the setup. **Picture** holds the image‑quality tuning (a coherent group,
split off from Video like the Graphic EQ is split off from Audio); **Video** holds
the output/connectivity settings (video mode, HDMI setup, on‑screen display, TV/4K
signal format). The lists below are grouped by entity type; each entity lands on
the sub‑device its setting belongs to.

- **Media player** per zone (main + zone 2 where present): power, volume, mute,
  source selection, and (main zone) sound mode. On the main zone, network sources
  show **album art, track/artist/album and play/pause/next transport** (via HEOS);
  otherwise the player carries a source‑aware **input icon** (TV, disc, tuner,
  Bluetooth, USB, cast, …).
- **Sound mode** as two coupled selects: a genre group (Movie/Music/Game/Pure)
  and the modes within the active group (context aware, includes Auto).
- **Selects**: Dynamic Compression, Dynamic Volume, Reference Level Offset,
  MultEQ, Restorer, ECO, Front Display dimmer, Video Mode, Picture Mode, HDMI
  Monitor Out, HDMI Audio Out (Amp/TV), HDMI Resolution, Aspect Ratio, Input Mode
  (ARC/eARC/…), Quick Select, Subwoofer Mode (LFE / LFE+Main), Room Size, Volume
  Scale, Volume Limit, Muting Level, a per speaker group crossover frequency (Hz)
  plus a Crossover Speaker Selection (All / Individual) that gates them against a
  single All Crossover,
  a per speaker group size (Large/Small), Front Speaker (A/B/A+B), Amp Assign
  (the amp‑assignment mode — options are read from the receiver per its amp type,
  e.g. 7.1ch + Front B / 9.1ch / Bi‑Amp / Zone2), the amp‑assign Floor Layout and
  Height Speakers (options read from the receiver), and LPF for LFE (80–250 Hz).
  On **Video**: HDMI Power‑Off Control,
  Pass‑Through Source, RC Select, On‑Screen Volume position, Now‑Playing display,
  4K Signal Format, TV Format (NTSC/PAL). On **Picture**: Noise Reduction. Each
  only when the receiver advertises it.
- **Switches**: Main Power, Main Mute, Tone Control, Dynamic EQ, Loudness
  Management, Cinema EQ, Subwoofer, Speaker Virtualizer, Center Spread,
  DTS Neural:X, Low Frequency Containment (LFC), Graphic EQ, Auto Lip Sync,
  All Zone Stereo, and — on **Video** — HDMI Control (CEC), ARC/eARC, TV Audio
  Switching, HDMI Power Saving, Smart Menu, HDMI Pass‑Through, On‑Screen Info.
- **Numbers**: Bass, Treble, Subwoofer Level, LFE, Dialog Control, Center Level
  Adjust, Audio Delay, Effect Level, Containment Amount, Sleep Timer, per channel
  volume trim and speaker distance (m) for each configured speaker, and — on
  **Picture** — Contrast, Brightness, Saturation, Enhancer.
- **Graphic EQ** (a sub‑device, when the receiver has one): the on/off, a
  speaker‑selection mode (L/R · Each · All), the channel being adjusted, and one
  slider per band (63 Hz … 16 kHz). Selecting a channel loads that channel's own
  curve; the sliders **stage** it and **Apply** writes the whole band block to
  the receiver at once. **Copy Curve** seeds the manual EQ from the reference
  curve, and **Default** resets the channel to flat. See the equalizer card
  recipe below.
- **Sensors** (diagnostic): sample rate, decoder, audio format, input signal,
  mode info, sound mode, and volume (dB).
- **Binary sensor**: telnet connectivity.

Per channel trims and distances, and per group crossovers and sizes, for
speakers the receiver has **not** configured are registered but disabled by
default; enable them from the entity settings if you need them.

Speaker crossover frequencies are a discrete, non-uniform set, so they are
exposed as a select rather than a stepped number. The current crossover per group
is read over telnet; the selectable frequencies are the fixed Denon
crossover grid (a protocol constant, verified live), the same as every other
enum's values.

### Graphic equalizer card

The graphic EQ is exposed as plain entities (one number per band, plus the
speaker‑selection and channel selects), so any card can drive it. For a proper
fader look, this integration does **not** ship a card (an integration must not);
instead install a mixer/fader card from HACS — for example **`wrodie/mixer-card`**
— and point it at the band numbers. A minimal Lovelace example:

```yaml
type: vertical-stack
cards:
  - type: entities
    entities:
      - switch.avr_x3600h_graphic_eq
      - select.avr_x3600h_speaker_selection
      - select.avr_x3600h_eq_channel
      - button.avr_x3600h_apply
      - button.avr_x3600h_copy_curve
      - button.avr_x3600h_default
  - type: custom:mixer-card
    faders:
      - entity_id: number.avr_x3600h_eq_63_hz
      - entity_id: number.avr_x3600h_eq_125_hz
      - entity_id: number.avr_x3600h_eq_250_hz
      - entity_id: number.avr_x3600h_eq_500_hz
      - entity_id: number.avr_x3600h_eq_1_khz
      - entity_id: number.avr_x3600h_eq_2_khz
      - entity_id: number.avr_x3600h_eq_4_khz
      - entity_id: number.avr_x3600h_eq_8_khz
      - entity_id: number.avr_x3600h_eq_16_khz
```

Pick a channel, adjust the nine faders, then press **Apply** to write that
channel's curve. Editing requires MultEQ **off** and the graphic EQ **enabled**
(both are entities above). Entity ids follow your device name — adjust the prefix
to match yours.

## Notes and limitations

- Some parameters only apply to certain signals or sound modes (for example
  Dynamic Compression needs a Dolby/DTS bitstream, Video Mode needs an active
  video signal, Equalizer settings can not be altered when MultEQ is not Off).
  The receiver rejects changes that do not apply to the current
  context; this is expected Denon behavior, not an integration bug.
- Speaker distances and crossovers are supported over telnet (read/write). Other
  advanced one time setup settings that the receiver exposes only through its web
  UI's configuration API (full speaker layout, HDMI Control/CEC, per input
  assignment, some zone defaults) are not implemented.
- Room correction calibration remains a job for the receiver's own setup tooling.

## Testing

Protocol behavior was verified live against the following.

| Component                    | Version |
|------------------------------|---------|
| Receiver                     | Denon AVR-X3600H |
| Receiver hardware generation | `avr-x-2016` |
| Receiver firmware            | 3.88.614 |
| Home Assistant Core          | 2026.7.0 |
| Python                       | 3.13 |

Other Denon/Marantz HEOS generation receivers should work as the integration
adapts to whatever the device reports, but only this combination has been
exercised end to end.
